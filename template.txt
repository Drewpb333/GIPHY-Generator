** GIPHY Generator

*create an array called topics that contains movies

*Js should automatic.ally take topics and create buttons of them.
A forEach loop on topics should be created.  Each iteration will
create a button, as well as data-content attributes with the movie's name.
They also should have still and live attributes that contain the different 
URLs.


*An event listener for the movie buttons div should be created (i.e. on()).
When a movie button is clicked, an event handler function will use 
this.attr("data-content").  An ajax call will be initiated, with q being
equal to "data-content" and limit equal to 10.  The images will then
be appended in movies using a div. In the div will be the gif,
as well as object property information from the GIPHY generator web site.


*add an .on("click") event listener for the submit button.  When pressed
it will add the button to the movie array.  It will then call the
the makeButton function to create buttons for all of the items in movie array.

*add an .on("click") event listener for the gifs.  When they are clicked,
a this.attr() will be used to switch out the still or animated url 
which are already attributes.
